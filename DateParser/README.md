# DateParser<br />
Python script for parsing date from bash `date` into more readable form.<br />
Script was written in the process of learning python.<br />
<br />
## Installation:
Just copy script into any location and change execution flag.<br />
```
chmod +x dateParser.py
```
<br />
## Usage:
pipe `date` into dateParser.py
```
date | dateParser.py
```
<br />
## Known problems:
Script doesn't parse date from LC_TIME=pl_PL.UTF-8 (yet).<br />

Any feedback is more than welcome. Let me know what you think about that application!<br />
