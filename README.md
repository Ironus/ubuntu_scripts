# ubuntu_scripts
Repository for storing usefull bash scripts and c/java source codes. 
All of them were written by me and tested on Ubuntu 14.04. If you find any errors/mistakes or better solution to use in my code, then write me an email on konzie@st.amu.edu.pl with proper subject (ex. [Better solution] BatteryLife.sh) and give me short explanation whats is wrong or why your solution is better. I will put your name in credits and change my code accordingly.
